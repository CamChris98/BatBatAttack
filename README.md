# BatBatAttack
# Overview
This is a game inspired by the game "Flappy Bird", the goal is to fly between the obstacles and build up a score until you die, and then restart the game if wanted. 

I wrote this software to demonstrate familiarity and experimentation with the unity game engine.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the game being played and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment
I used the Unity engine and the Visual Studio IDE to write the scripts used in the game. 

The Unity Engine uses the C# programming language for its scripts, which is what i used to write in this project.
